    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I took on the exciting challenge of building an omni-directional car entirely from scratch. The car incorporates MQTT for communication, distance IR sensors to prevent collisions, and is written in Python. Additionally, I developed a controlling app using MQTT for control, which is written in React Native.</p>
    <p>By combining the power of MQTT, Python, distance IR sensors, React Native, Raspberry Pi, and GPIO, this project demonstrates a comprehensive integration of hardware and software technologies. The result is an omni-directional car with advanced control capabilities, collision avoidance features, and a user-friendly controlling app, showcasing the possibilities of robotics and IoT applications.</p>
    <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Python</li>
      <li>MQTT</li>
      <li>Distance IR Sensors</li>
      <li>React Native</li>
      <li>Raspberry Pi</li>
      <li>GPIO</li>
    </ul>
   
    <p>
      I used python because for hardware this has been my default on raspberry PI projects.
      React native on the other hand was completely new to me The reason I used it was purely because
      I am familiar with react and this was the easiest for me. Plus it is also both compatible with IOS and android.
    </p>
    <h3>IR Sensors</h3>
    <p>
      The reason for using ir sensors over the alternatives like the ultrasonic distance sensor was simply its digital output,
      as that works with the raspberry pi and also its quick response time as the car can move faster then the ultrasonic sensor can respond.
    </p>
   
    <h2>Project Details</h2>
    <p>The Omni-directional car project involved designing and assembling a unique car mechanism that allows it to move effortlessly in any direction. The car is equipped with multiple wheels that can move independently, enabling both translation and rotation in any combination, resulting in omni-directional mobility.</p>
    
    <p>To ensure the car's safety and prevent collisions, I integrated distance IR sensors into its design. These sensors provide real-time feedback on the proximity of obstacles, allowing the car to make informed decisions and automatically adjust its movement to avoid potential collisions.</p>
    
    <p>The communication and control of the omni-directional car are facilitated by the MQTT protocol. MQTT is lightweight, efficient, and perfect for Internet of Things (IoT) applications like this project. It enables reliable messaging between the car's components and the controlling app, ensuring seamless and responsive control over the car's movements.</p>
    
    <p>The controlling app, developed using React Native, offers a cross-platform solution with a native-like user experience. React Native allows for rapid development, code reusability, and provides access to device-specific features, making it an excellent choice for building the controlling app. The reactive interface ensures smooth and responsive control of the omni-directional car.</p>
    
    <p>The project leveraged the power of Raspberry Pi, a versatile single-board computer. Raspberry Pi's small form factor, low power consumption, and GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) capabilities made it an ideal platform for controlling the car. By utilizing GPIO pins and H-bridge motor controllers, the Raspberry Pi effectively controlled the motors responsible for the car's movement, allowing precise and reliable motor control.</p>
    
    <h2>Controlling App</h2>
    <p>The controlling app establishes an MQTT connection with the omni-directional car, enabling real-time control.</p>
    
    <p>The app's live video feed from the car's onboard camera enhances situational awareness, enabling users to view the surroundings and navigate effectively. The combination of video streaming and MQTT-based control makes the app a powerful tool for remotely operating and monitoring the omni-directional car.</p>
    
    <h2>Car Controller</h2>
    <p>
      For the car controller i have a MQTT client and a simple file to handle all sorts of movement.
